## How to Download the Code

After each class, we will upload the code to the repository. You can access it in two ways:

1. **View the Code on GitHub**  
   You can directly access the repository at [G6 Repository](https://github.com/qa-codecademy/mkwd13-02-basicwebdev/tree/main/G6). Under the `G6` folder, we will have subfolders for each class:

```

G6
├── Class01
├── Class02
├── Class03
└── ... (and so on)

```

Open the corresponding class folder to view the code directly on GitHub.

2. **Download the Repository as a ZIP File**

- Go to the main repository page: [Basic Web Development Repository](https://github.com/qa-codecademy/mkwd13-02-basicwebdev/tree/main).
- On the right corner, click on the green **<> Code** button and select **Download ZIP**.
- After downloading, unzip the file on your computer.
- Navigate to the `G6` folder, where you’ll find all the code organized by class.

> **NOTE:** Until we cover Git installation in class, you can use this method to access the code. In upcoming sessions, we will introduce a more efficient approach to downloading code using Git. Once we do that, this README will be updated accordingly.

3. **HOMEWORKS**

- The homework requirement that you will finish, zip it, and send it to both of us, meaning in the mail add both of us as recipients so we can better coodrinate for the feedbacks. NOTE: For now this is the way we gonna follow to send homeworks, in the upcomming sessions we will introduce a better approach.
