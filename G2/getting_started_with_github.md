# Getting Started with GitHub on the Browser

GitHub provides a browser-based interface that allows you to create, manage, and share projects without needing to install any software. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com).
2. Sign up for a free account if you don’t already have one. This will be your gateway to hosting code, collaborating on projects, and showcasing your work.

## Step 2: Understanding Key Concepts

- **Repository (Repo)**: A folder on GitHub where code is stored. It contains all your project files and their history.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes. Think of it as saving your work with a description of what you changed.
- **Branch**: A separate version of the project you can work on without affecting the main codebase. Most projects start with a main branch.

## Step 3: Creating a New Repository

1. After logging in, click on the **+** icon (top right) and select **New repository**.
2. Give your repository a name and add a description (optional).
3. Choose whether to make it **public** (visible to everyone) or **private** (only visible to you and collaborators).
4. Check the box to add a README file (optional), then click **Create repository**.

## Step 4: Uploading Files Directly

1. Inside your new repo, click on **Add file** > **Upload files** to upload any project files from your computer.

## Step 5: Making and Committing Changes

1. You can edit files directly on GitHub by clicking on a file, selecting the pencil icon to edit, and writing a commit message that describes your changes.
2. Click **Commit changes** to save.

# Creating a GitHub Page (github.io) to Host a Website

GitHub Pages is a great way to create and host simple websites directly from your GitHub repository, ideal for portfolios, project documentation, or demo sites. GitHub will automatically generate a `.github.io` domain for you!

## Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Pages Repository

1. If you want a personal GitHub page, create a new repository with the format `<yourusername>.github.io`.
   For example, if your GitHub username is `alexa93`, your repository name should be `alexa93.github.io`.
2. Make this repository **public** so that GitHub can host your website.

## Step 2: Add Your Web Files

1. In your `username.github.io` repository, click on **Add file** > **Upload files**.
2. Drag and drop an `index.html` file (or other website files) to the repository. This `index.html` file will serve as the homepage of your GitHub Pages site.
3. Commit the files by selecting **Commit changes**.

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to the **Settings** tab of your repository.
2. Scroll down to the **Pages** section on the left side.
3. In the **Source** section, select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages. By default, you can select **main** and save.
4. GitHub will provide the link to your new site, which should look like `https://<yourusername>.github.io`.

## Step 4: Access and Use Your GitHub Page

- Your GitHub Page will be accessible at `https://<yourusername>.github.io`.
- Any changes you make to your repository will automatically update on your GitHub Page after you commit them.

## Things to Try:

- **Add more pages**: Create new `.html` files like `about.html` or `contact.html` and link them from `index.html`.
- **Use Markdown for README**: GitHub can also host markdown pages. Add a `README.md` file for project descriptions and documentation.
